# JSONApp
Application powered by an Angular Frontend and .NET Backend utilitizing the online JSON placeholder fake API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

Goals: 
(1) Display a list of users.
(2) Selecting a user should display albums for the user.
(3) A list of albums should show a thumbnail image of the first photo in the album.
(4) Clicking on an album should show all photos in the album.

** the photos that are served from this api are hosted at via.placeholder.com, which is no longer active I don't believe, so I've generated random photos from picsum.com to simulate functionality.
