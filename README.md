# JSONApp
This is a simple demo application built to practice full-stack development using Angular on the frontend and .NET on the backend.

The app consumes data from the free public API at JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which returns fake user, album, and photo data. 

Goals:<br />

(1) Display a list of users.<br />
(2) Selecting a user should display albums for the user.<br />
(3) A list of albums should show a thumbnail image of the first photo in the album.<br />
(4) Clicking on an album should show all photos in the album.<br />

** The photos that are served from this api are hosted at via.placeholder.com, which is no longer active I don't believe. Because of this, I've generated random photos from picsum.com to simulate functionality.
